    -f your multiquatex query
    -l the parallelism degree to use (across how many processes should the simulations be distributed)
    -ds a single delta (of the confidence interval) value for all the properties in the query, the list of delta with one value per property in the query
    -a the alpha value (of the confidence interval) 
    -otherParams the command you type in your terminal to run pyhton 3.

In addition, 

    -sots is used to generate the list of random seeds used by MultiVeStA. If you provide it, the very same analysis (very same simulations) will be performed every time you run this command (for replicability). If this is not of interest, just remove -sots 1
    -vp can be used to disable the generation of interactive plots if not needed.

    -s.rval(0)   -> 1.0 if final step else 0.0   
    -s.rval(1)   -> returns current simulated time  
    -s.rval(2)   -> counts the steps of simulation 
    -s.rval(5)   -> the average time spent by tasks in queues 
    -s.rval(6)   -> returns the number of executed tasks 
    -s.rval(11)  -> the ratio os successfully executed small tasks
    -s.rval(12)  -> the ratio os successfully executed large tasks
    -s.rval(13)  -> the ratio os successfully executed all tasks
